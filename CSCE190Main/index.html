        <section class="statement">
            <p>My personal mission is to leverage my computer science skills and my dedication to knowledge to advance the field of aerospace technology. As I work through college, my goal is to gain hands-on experience and the knowledge required to prepare for a future where I can contribute to groundbreaking projects and eventually bring humanity to the new space-age. I am driven by a passion for exploration, innovation, and the belief that technology will, and can, help us unlock the mysteries of space and allow our children, and theirs forevermore, to not only see, but touch upon the stars themselves.</p>
